# Azure KeyVault Integration in podman-compose-mgr

## Azure Authentication Issues with v0.22

The project encountered authentication issues after upgrading from azure_identity v0.21 to v0.22. The main error message is:

```
Failed to create credential: No credential sources were available to be used for authentication.
```

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1. **Added Detailed Logging**: Added comprehensive debug output to diagnose credential creation issues.

2. **Modified Environment Variables**: Ensured proper setting of the required environment variables:
   - AZURE_TENANT_ID
   - AZURE_CLIENT_ID
   - AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET

3. **API Compatibility**: Fixed code to work with the updated azure_identity v0.22 API.

4. **Credential Builder Configuration**: Attempted to use different credential builder configurations.

## Current Status

The authentication is still failing with the error "No credential sources were available to be used for authentication." This suggests:

1. The Azure credentials might not be valid or might have expired
2. The Azure API requirements might have changed significantly between v0.21 and v0.22
3. The Rust Azure SDK might have an incompatibility with the current version

## Next Steps to Resolve

Here are potential next steps to resolve the authentication issues:

1. **Verify Azure Credentials**: Ensure the client ID, tenant ID, and client secret are still valid by testing them directly through the Azure portal or CLI.

2. **Test with a Different Application**: Create a simple standalone application using azure_identity v0.22 to isolate the issue.

3. **Use Azure CLI Authentication**: The DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder supports using the Azure CLI credentials. You might try configuring the Azure CLI first and then use it for authentication.

4. **Check Dependencies**: Review the dependency tree to ensure all Azure-related packages are compatible versions.

5. **Downgrade Azure SDK**: If the v0.22 API is causing issues, consider temporarily downgrading to v0.21 until the compatibility issues are resolved.

6. **Option to Use Service Principal**: If client_id/client_secret isn't working, consider setting up and using a service principal for authentication instead.

## Integration Test Implementation

Despite the authentication issues, the following components have been implemented:

1. **Debug Tools**: Detailed debugging tools that show authentication processes and attempt multiple authentication methods.

2. **Error Handling**: Improved error handling with detailed output that helps identify the source of authentication failures.

3. **Integration Tests**: Test files that can be run with `cargo test` once the authentication is fixed.

4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation about the Azure integration, including troubleshooting steps.

The test can be run using:

```bash
cargo run --bin podman-compose-mgr -- --path ~/docker --mode restart-svcs --secrets-client-id tests/personal_testing_data/client_id.txt --secrets-client-secret-path tests/personal_testing_data/secrets.txt --secrets-tenant-id tests/personal_testing_data/tenant_id.txt --secrets-vault-name tests/personal_testing_data/vault_name.txt --secret-mode-output-json tests/personal_testing_data/outfile.json --secret-mode-input-json tests/personal_testing_data/input.json --verbose
```

## Conclusion

The Azure authentication is failing with `azure_identity` v0.22, but the codebase has been updated to handle the new API structure. Once valid credentials are available or compatibility issues resolved, the integration tests should work properly.
